## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, I was interestested in using Udacity data regarding Sparkify music platform. I used tiny subset (128MB) of the full dataset available (12GB).
Sparkify is a fictional music platform. The goal of the project is to analyze user behavior and predict which users will cancel their subscriptions (churn). Paid accounts contribute to company's revenue and it is significant to identify customers that may churn.
I analyzed Sparkify dataset from the Udacity platform also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kuixizhu/sparkify-small-log)<br />
I will biuld classification ML model to predict if a platform's user will churn. To evaluate the model I will use area under PR curve as the final dataset is imbalanced and the problem is to optimize positive class.  

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There is 1 notebook available [here](Project1_Boston_Kaggle.ipynb) to showcase work while analizing data and building ML model.

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@graza89/ce59d7e1173f) and in markdown cells in the notebook.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>
Licensing for the data and other descriptive information of a dataset is available at the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kuixizhu/sparkify-small-log).<br />
