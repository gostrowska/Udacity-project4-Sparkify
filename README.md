## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, I was interestested in using Kaggle data regarding Boston Airbnb listings.
Airbnb is a popular platform among travelers. It is easy and convenient for tourists to rent a house, apartment, private room or shared room on the other side of the world.
It is also easy to rent a property through Airbnb. Therefore, many people see Airbnb as an opportunity to earn extra money. Those people may be interested what factors impact rental price most.
I analyzed Airbnb listings from the [Kaggle Boston Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston?resource=download&select=listings.csv)<br />
When analyzing the data, I will answer three questions:
1. Is price higher for a property with a host or without? Is it more profitable to rent the entire property?
2. Which areas in Boston are most expensive?
3. Which factors influence property price in Boston the most?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There is 1 notebook available [here](Project1_Boston_Kaggle.ipynb) to showcase work while answering above 3 questions.

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@graza89/ce59d7e1173f) and in markdown cells in the notebook.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>
